title: Lenovo T480 config on Ubuntu
---

About a month ago, I finally bought a new laptop. While my previous one, the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, certainly is a great device, it just has too many quirks when using Linux on it. On top of that, the wifi chip was broken, making it somewhat useless on the go.

After a lot of comparisons, I went for a Lenovo T480. The build quality is, as expected, top notch and Ubuntu 18.04 runs out of the box with no further complications.
Unfortunately the device was running rather hot, even when idle. The reasons for this are the dedicated Nvidia MX150 GPU, as well as high CPU usage caused by the Thunderbolt settings in the BIOS.

## Disabling MX150 on the T480

Out of the box, Ubuntu will install "nouveau" drivers. As an alternative, proprietary nvidia drivers can also be installed by starting "Software & Updates" and switching the drivers. The Nvidia driver allows you to easily change the GPU in use, though in my case was not sufficient.

After some reasearch, there seem to be following methods that will properly turn off the dedicated GPU:

### Option 1) Proprietary Nvidia drivers and powertop --auto-tune

(This way worked best for my setup)

<https://askubuntu.com/a/490401> (register powertop service)  
<https://askubuntu.com/a/1061055> (disable nvidia-fallback service)


1. "Software & Updates" > Drivers > Switch to proprietary nvidia drivers
2. Reboot (while enrolling Secure Boot key)
3. `sudo prime-select intel` (or: "Nvidia X Server Settings" > "PRIME Profiles" > Select "Intel (Power Saving Mode)")

If this already works, great! Powertop was still showing the MX150 to use power though, so following steps were necessary:

4. Install powertop and disable nvidia-fallback service

```
sudo apt install powertop
sudo systemctl disable nvidia-fallback.service
```

5. Create file `/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service` with following contents:

```
[Unit]
Description=PowerTOP auto tune

[Service]
Type=idle
Environment="TERM=dumb"
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/powertop --auto-tune

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

6. Enable the service:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable powertop.service
```

This will register a new systemd service, automatically running powertop optimizations on startup.

### Option 2) Change Display server and blacklist Nvidia drivers

Reference:  
<https://askubuntu.com/questions/1031511/cant-disable-nouveau-drivers-in-ubuntu-18-04>

Another option that seems to work, is blacklisting the nvidia related kernel modules. This generally works by adding something to `/etc/modproble.d/blacklist.conf`, but since Ubuntu (in my case) is running on Wayland, the display server must be switched back to X11 first.

You can figure out what display server your session is running on by doing the following:

```
loginctl
>   SESSION        UID USER             SEAT             TTY             
>        c1        120 gdm              seat0            tty1            
>         2       1000 luca             seat0            tty2            

loginctl show-session c1 -p Type
> Type=wayland

```

To actually switch back to X11, the following step seem to be simple enough (if you are using gnome)
1. Uncomment `WaylandEnable=false` in `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf`

While this changes the display server, it does not change much about the gpu in use. To disable the MX150:

3. Add the following lines to `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`

```
blacklist nouveau
blacklist lbm-nouveau
alias nouveau off
alias lbm-nouveau off
```

4. `sudo update-initramfs -u`
5. restart

## Thunderbolt BIOS Assist Mode (High CPU usage fix)

<https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T/T480-CPU-temperature-and-fan-speed-under-linux/m-p/4114832>

**BIOS:**
Config > "Thunderbolt(TM) 3" >
* Thunderbolt BIOS Assist Mode [Enabled]

## Other power-saving options and configs

I won't go into too much detail here, but for my own reference, here are the other settings I've done.

```
sudo apt install tlp
```

**BIOS:**  
Security > "I/O Port Access" >
* Bluetooth [Disabled]
* Integrated Camera [Disabled]
* Microphone [Disabled]
* Fingerprint Reader [Disabled]
