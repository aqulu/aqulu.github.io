title: Washing clothes and Ghibli museum
---

Finally gave washing clothing a try. And everthing worked out well! Took me about 15 minutes to figure out hot to input the correct settings and all. It might seem strange to people passing by, that some confused looking foreigner is staring at the washing machine. But that's kindof a given, if the washing machines at home work so differently and you can't read half of the words written on the machine :-K

Instead of specifying a time and temperature, you can adjust the water-level (makes sense, since the washing machine isn't always filled to the top) and something about air-drying on that very machine. I might take a picture later on and explain everything for future use.



Anyways, I've been walking around a lot again. Akihabara, Harajuku and all those places - pretty much the same as they were when I last went there. The most exciting thing was definitly the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka. I like some Ghibli movies, but far from all - and still enjoyed the museum a lot. While it wasn't huge and you actually cannot do much else than look at things, it was one of the best attractions I ever went to in Japan. The atmosphere of the museum and every room inside is unique and makes you daydream, almost like when watching Ghibli movies. People respected the no-photo policy inside, letting you enjoy the experience just so much more. Even if you're not a huge Ghibli nerd, you definitely should go there (if you can get your hands on a ticket, of course)!


Just a few photos, from where taking pictures was allowed:
