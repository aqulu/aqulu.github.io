title: the search for a dojo
---

Nothing spectacular happened for the rest of the week, I think I'm slowly getting used to life in Tokyo...
Washing clothes and everything is not nearly as annoying as I expected it to be - put everthing into the machine, do something else for like an hour and wait for everything to dry after that.

I'm still no good at estimating the amount of food for cooking though. What I cooked on thursday was more than enough for like 3 meals (dinner, lunch and dinner again)... My tofu-cream-mushroom thingy tasted way better than what I made last time. I'm getting better at cooking :-) 


# not much to do at work

Work wasn't too busy this week. I has only a few tasks, not more than a days amount of work. I wanted to use the spare time to do something remotely connected to my work, so I started learning <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Rust</a>, a systems programming language. It promises to be balzingly fast and guarantees memory safety. Although I don't really care about the speed of a programming language, I love knowing what happens at runtime (lifetime of variables and all that). In addition to that the documentation is fantastic and it's community is lively and welcoming to beginners.


Now I just have to think of some project, where I could use Rust...


# the search for a dojo

I've been training karate by myself up until now, since I wanted to meet Kohata-sensei first.

It was a little strange at first, being a vegetarian in a yakitori restuarant, but I had a pleasant evening thanks to Kohata-sensei who was taking care of me. 
He even invited me to his dojo, but since it's a rather long way from any places I'm at, I cannot make it during the week (maybe on saturdays though). He also recommended two other dojos around Shinagawa - I'll check these out next week :)

People on facebook thought I'm female. I'm so pretty ^_^;
