# more about work
How time flies! Already more than a week at my workplace. While I still love the company for the people and the liberal environment, I was a little disappointed in the code-quality... Seems like there have been a lot of amateurs at work (or maybe they just didn't care?) ^_^;

I've been fixing a lot of strange code the past few days. Maybe it's php, that's more attracting to people who don't know how to code properly (although I wonder why...), but it seems that a lot of php-coders don't really know what they're doing. I hope to be able to make some changes in the company regarding that aspect - but that will take some time.


By the way, I asked my department superintendent about installing another operation system on it. Linux, here I come!! Work is getting better and better!

# New phone

On saturday my girlfriend helped me making a mobile-contract (after going to the SoftBank store twice, both at times which they didn't accept any more customers), so I finally have a Japanese phonenumber and mobile internet! Since my old smartphone didn't have some kind of certification, I had to get a new one to use the sim-card. I now call myself a proud owner of a Nexus 6P - and MAN that phone is huge! 5.7 inch display.


Except for it's size, the 6P a pretty awesome device. Runs very smoothly and already on Android 7.0.


Since I care somewhat about privacy and all, I had to change a lot of settings from the default configuration. Android is a huge pain in the ass when it comes to that... Almost everything you do is being uploaded to Google's servers. I know that it might improve your experience to some extent, but still think it's kinda creepy, that so many aspects of my life is being shared with some company.

I spent almost 2 hours uninstalling and disabling unwanted Google applications, turning off "features" like the automatic upload of keyboard inputs, location data, photos and so on. I also don't trust the Google Mail client or the voice recogintion, so I had to stop these as well, just as whatever else I stumbled upon browsing through the endless list of settings
...and people were complaining about Windows 10's privacy settings - at the time it took me less than 5 minutes to turn off what's being shared there (and no, I'm not defending Microsoft here).


# my weekend

As already mentioned, I spent saturday with my girlfriend at SoftBank and after that we went out for dinner. She had to work on sunday, so I went to a Dali exhibition with Emi, who owns a pass, that allows her to get into a lot of museums for free (she can take along a friend as well). Using that pass we went to 3 or 4 other exhibitions in Roppongi :-)


In the evening I met Luzi again for an underground concert of a few Japanese amateur bands. Some of them we're actually really good and we had a great time hanging out with the people there. It was a very small concert, 20 people in the audience tops.

Listening to all these bands made me want to play the guitar all the more - but buying one has to wait until November 25th, since I don't have too much money until I recieve my first paycheck \*_\*
