title: Becoming a resident
---

There already are a few helpful websites and blogs about becoming a resident in Japan, and luckily these still applied to what I had do to.

# At the airport

If the airport is big enough, you can exchange your "certificate of eligibility" and the visa you got in your home country for a Japanese residence card. Just ask one of the clerks at the immigration what to do (or just show your certificate of eligibility). At Narita airport just follow the "foreign passports" line - you'll be pointed to another desk than people who are getting a regular tourist visa. You might have to wait a little, since they have to print a residence card for everyone in your line (I had to wait for about 15 minutes with 3 or 4 people standing in front of me).


# At the place you stay

Once you got your residence card and a place to stay, you should get registered at your local city hall within 14 days. Just search the internet for the address or ask any person on the street where it's located.

Bring your passport and your residence card and tell the receptionist you want to get registered. I went to <a href="http://www.city.ota.tokyo.jp/shisetsu/kuyakusho/index.html" target="_blank">this</a> office and was pointed to a document stand labelled "A". Another clerk then points you to the form you have to fill in (example was provided). Draw a ticket and wait until it's your turn to go to the counter (counter 6, if I recall correctly). You'll be guided through everything, taking about 5 minutes. I had to wait another 10 minutes until I got my residence card back, this time with my address printed on it's back.


The lady pointed out, that I'll be receiving a myNumber card by mail. <a href="http://www.accessj.com/2013/05/my-number-welcome-to-japans-new-unified.html" target="_blank">Read more about "myNumber"</a>.

She also asked about my health insurance - if possible, I'll join my company's health insurance. She told me to come back, if this doesn't work out - sounded like you can join a national health insurance or something of the likes.
