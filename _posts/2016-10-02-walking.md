title: Walking! And CHEESE!

# Wandering around

On my last few days before I begin work, I walked around quite a lot. I started at my place, which is approximately 1.8km south from Kamata station. Without any aim or goal, I ended up at Tokyo tower, passing through Shinagawa and Tennozu Isle, and went further to Roppongi - in total somewhat around 21km.

# My Todos in Tokyo

Since you cannot do much while walking, I started making a list of things I have to do while I'm still in Tokyo and before I even can consider leaving Japan. My current list:

* Read (and understand) a Detective Conan manga without a dictionary
* Climb Fuji-san
* High five the train-conductor who leans out of the last wagon
* Take ocarina lessons
* Be able to play Gyakuten Saiban in Japanese
* Play Shakuhachi or Shamizen at least once


What a productive day! This will make my time here so much more fun :-)


In the evening I met Luzi, a friend from Germany who is staying here on a working holiday visa. We met about half a year ago in Tokyo, and went eat something and get some drinks. I had a lot of fun catching up with him, and hope to meet him again soon!

# Weekend

On the following days, saturday and sunday, I did some freelets workouts in a sports park about 2km from my home. Around lunchtime I found a cafe- / pasta-place called "Märchen" on my way to the station. It's a little pricy, but the owner is nice enough and the food is also pretty good...

After having lunch, I finally met my girlfriend, and we spent the first day(s) together in a very long time. Feels good to live so close again, both of us got somewhat tired of the long distance relationship... We walked around somewhat, had something to eat and went to the movies in the evening. 
Sunday morning I was lucky enough to find this:

It's been about 2 weeks, but man, I missed cheese! It cost me almost a fortune (700yen), but still... Cheese!!! What an awesome end to an already great weekend :-)
