Even though I set my alarm to 6:25 AM on the day before, my phone decieded NOT to wake me up. Luckily my mom woke me up 45 minutes before I was supposed to leave, so I still had plenty of time.
After I packed the rest of my stuff and double checked I didn't forget anything important, we went to the airport.

Flo arrived a few minutes after we did, so I was already waiting in line at the checkin counter. To my surprise Corina and Susi came as well :open_mouth:. We had a coffe at Starbucks and after approximately an hour I took off - boarding time on intercontinental flights are pretty early... Thank you again for coming to see me off, it meant a lot to me!


The flight with Etihad Ariways pretty decent - even though the first part from Zurich to Abu Dhabi felt like a street-market (people were exchanging seats all the time). The flight from Abu Dhabi to Narita was amongst the best I took so far. People behaved well, service was as good as Turkish Airlines or Emirates and the meals were good as well!


After going through the whole immigration procedure at Narita airport, I took the Narita Express to Shinagawa, where I met Kaoru around 4 PM. We went to my sharehouse, where I dropped off my luggage, to walk around the neighborhood and buy necessities like bathing towels, shampoo and so on. By the way, it's a lot of fun to walk around carrying your luggage during a typhoon! :no_mouth:

Kaoru left soon thereafter, since she had to get up around 3AM for an early flight the next day. She stayed until I signed all the contracts and made sure I understood everything. Hell of a lot of text to basicaly say "behave or we might throw you out" and "you'll pay for anything you (accidentally) destroy".
