title: First day and running errands
---

Exhausted from the long flight and the many information I got from the sharehouse manager, I decided to take a shower and go to sleep soon. Did I mention I got the towels from a 100 yen shop? Probably not, but the quality was decent enough. I didn't wash them before using it. Good idea, right? Right...


The towel did what it was supposed to, so I was still happy with my purchase.

Stupid or tired as I was (hope it's just the latter, but might be a good mix of both), I forgot the wet towel on my brand new white bed sheets and walked around for about an hour. Got a nice red stain there now. ^_^;


## The next day

I got up and decided to run some errands:

1. register as a resident
2. open a bank account
3. get a cellphone contract
4. get a wifi-switch

The first one was rather easy. Head to the local city hall and follow the instructions of the office clerks (details in my previous post).


Opening a bank account proved to be a little more difficult: Mizuho and UFJ something around Kamata station both require a stamp or seal to open an account.

I asked Emi for further instructions, and she told me, it's probably best to go to a bank my company suggests. 


Third task requires a bank account, so I didn't pursue that.


My shoes were still wet from the typhoon the other day, so I extended my list with task 3.5: "buying shoes". I found a pair for 1400 yen, which also looks better than my current pair.


The rooms in my sharehouse are equipped with a wired internet connection, but most of my deviced don't have an ehternet port anymore (Surface Pro 3, Nexus 7, Smartphone, Kindle). Luckily I had only one room to cover with wireless connection and the bandwith also doesn't really matter for just one person, so I got the cheapest switch I found, which supports up to 433 mbps. I can now use the internet in my room instead of running down to the shared lunch-room all the time.



As I finished my errands, I decided it's time to go to that gymnastics room the sharehouse offers and do some Karate. That felt fantastic! Didn't get too much exercise the past few days (hackathon, packing things, flying). I'm really happy I moved into this particular sharehouse now :-)
