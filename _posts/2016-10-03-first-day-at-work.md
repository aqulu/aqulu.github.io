title: First day at work
---

Not sure if I have enough time for Karate training in the evening, I woke up to the alarm I set for 6AM. Following the example of Sandro-sensei, who has always been one of my role models for discipline and Karate, I practiced for a while after breakfast. I had a shower then and did some laundry then.


I left around 8:30, since work starts at 10AM. I was welcomed by everyone in the office and had to fill out a lot of paperwork for about 2 hours. Two of my coworkers, also foreigners, then introduced me to my work environment and so on. With so many new impressions the day was over very quick.

Even though you hear a lot of bad things about overwork in Japan, other people at there don't seem to mind, if you leave on time. I'm relieved and grateful to have found such an awesome company :-)


The only negative point of the day - and I know my dad will laugh at this - I have to use an iMac (ugh...). But as long as I can use the command line and my favorite editors, this isn't such a big problem anymore. Might have to buy a PC-keyboard, since I can't get used to apple's keyboard layout and shortcuts.


I'm already looking forward to my second day there!
