title: My last whole day in Switzerland
---
I think I did well keeping myself busy during the last few days, otherwise I would have been overthinking things, which makes leaving a lot harder.
I had a great time with friends from university at <a href="www.hackzurich.ch" target="_blank">hackzurich</a> and I visited a bunch of people for the last time in what's going to be quite a while.

It still feels a little weird and I don't think I fully realize that I'll really start my life in another environment starting tomorrow.
My mom and dad, as well as Flo will come and see me off at the airport.

And as Tsubasa (not Captain Tsubasa, but a friend) once said: this is not a goodbye, but rather a "see ya!". So on that note: 
# see ya, Switzerland!
