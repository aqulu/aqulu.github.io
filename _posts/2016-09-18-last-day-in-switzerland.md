title: My last days in Switzerland
---

I decided to attended <a href="www.hackzurich.ch" target="_blank">hackzurich</a> with friends from university. Sleeping on the floor for but a few hours two nights in a row left me a little sleep deprived this morning. Tired and a little stressed out (so many things todo before leaving!) I returned home, packed my bags and visited a bunch of people for the last time in what's going to be quite a while.

I think I did pretty well in keeping myself busy, otherwise I would have been overthinking things, which makes leaving a lot harder.
Still, it feels a little weird and I don't think I fully realize that I'll start my life in another environment tomorrow...


For my last few hours here, my mom and dad, as well as Flo will come and see me off at the airport. Hope that won't be too hard on me, but as Tsubasa (not Captain Tsubasa, but a friend) once said: this is not a goodbye, but rather a "see ya!". So on that note: 

# see ya, Switzerland!
