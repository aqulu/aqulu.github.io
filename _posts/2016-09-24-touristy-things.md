title: Touristy things
---

Walking around Tokyo made me feel like a tourist again. Well, maybe because I was hanging around with a tourist - Seline stays here until Wednesday. She introduced me to a friend of hers, who has been living in Tokyo since about 6 months and is originally from St. Gallen. Pretty awesome to meet another Swiss guy so early on!


We did some sightseeing stuff like walking around Shibuya and Ueno, but also went for lunch with Kumi (another friend of Selines), met Emi and hung around Tokyo Dome, where we went to see a Baseball game. It was a lot of fun, but living like a tourist also means, I spend money like one. I should be a little more careful with what I spend money on ^_^;


On Saturday morning I went to buy groceries. Emi told me the other day, there's a reasonably priced shop just arond the corner. Wow, that store is big! I'm used to not knowing my way around Swiss grocery stores, but that's taking it to a whole new level. The supermarket spreads over 4 floors, and I cannot read most of the signs (should do some kanji-homework...). I managed to find spaghetti, pesto sauce, bananas and so on, and even some yarn, but no luck with washing powder yet. I'll give it another try the next time.

I'm a little anxious about washing my clothes here anyway. Japanese people seem to just wash everything together - doesn't matter what color the article is. Since there's already a stain on my bed, I'll be a little careful with mixing my colored clothes with whites for starters. But more about that, when I've actually tried it :-)
