title: A lazy day and goodbye
---

Today I didn't do too much. A little workout, watched some videos online and met Seline in the late afternoon. She was with Béatrice, another girl from Switzerland, who has been in Japan since about half a year - her Japanese is really good!

This was the last evening, before Seline returns to Switzerland, so I wanted to show her the Lockup. "The Lockup" is a prison themed restaurant and reminds one of a haunted house. About every hour or so, monsters from hell escape and terrify the guests - but unfortunately, none of us could be scared that easily. The show was still a lot of fun (you even hear other people scream from their booths). The three of us went to get a crepe afterwards and, as always, to the "Hub" for a couple of beers. Béa drew a lot of fun things in the pub. Check out her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/herzig.bea" target="_blank">facebook page</a>, her artstyle is fantastic and also really funny. Most of the jokes are in French, but she's Swiss (she doesn't like being called "French").

We returned around half past ten, because Seline had to travel all the way to Narita station, where her hotel was.


Oh, check out this cool cap we found in the afternoon in a Don Quijote (bought it for a friend back in Switzerland :-) )
