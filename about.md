Hi! My name is Luca and I moved from Switzerland to Tokyo, Japan, on Semptember 19th. I'll blog about my everday life, so you can expect to find posts about my work as a programmer and my hobbies Karate and music. 

My current todo list in Tokyo:

[ ] Read (and understand) a Detective Conan manga without a dictionary
[ ] Climb Fuji-san
[ ] High five the train-conductor who leans out of the last wagon
[ ] Take ocarina lessons
[ ] Be able to play Gyakuten Saiban in Japanese
[ ] Play Shakuhachi or Shamizen at least once
